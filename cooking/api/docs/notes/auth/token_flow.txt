Menu is pivotal element in smooth flow
app uses 2 tokens: access (35 min lifespan) and refresh

1. when Menu renders(mounted) => request to dj server GET with axios header Authorization: null or 'access jwt'

2. if resp 401 (un-auth-ed) = > repeat each 30 min a new request to dj server 

2. if resp 200 (auth-ed) = > all user features for UI rendered in MENU
 and then repeat a new request to the server (each 30 min) to get new access if refresh token is valid 
otherwise logout via mutation and window.location.reload


// currnt: js native

const now = Math.ceil(Date.now()/1000)
             console.log("now is ",now)
             const tokenRefreshPayload = JSON.parse(atob(refreshToken.split('.')[1]));
             const expTerm = tokenRefreshPayload.exp

           interceptors   vs setTimeout(current)
1. Why NOT interceptors?
Ans: First request when Menu mounted => users/me
user first on site and not auth-ed=> resp 401 => lookup for refresh => No refresh => re-direct to login=> UI not friendly
+  response undefined (?) TODO
