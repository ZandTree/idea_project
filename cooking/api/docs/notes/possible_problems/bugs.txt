################## TODO: bugs to solve #########################################################
1. bug: front 'like' can be +1 if already done ( via optimistic mode) event it was toggled -=1|=> result 2!
although after reload/re-built comp - real like amount displayed

2.sorting by rating works not correctly (in reverse order); even on qs without apllying ordering func from drf 
problem persists without drf ordering; ? decimal field + null values |=> sort F('max_rating').desc(nulls_last=True? )
